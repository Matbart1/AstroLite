## Some things to expect in AstroLite:
1. Custom voiced SFX!
2. Scalable gameplay, similar to Risk of Rain progression!
3. Upgrades! Like Vampire Survivors!
4. Custom artwork, hand drawn by somebody with no business hand drawing artwork! :innocent:
5. 8-bit music from various artists!

# How do I play it??

> I have no idea! :sunglasses: 

I began creation of this game December 20th, 2023. Which means more than anything, I'm currently learning how to do any of this.
This game likely won't be available for release for awhile, but since this repository is public feel free to download the game
and give it a test run in Game Maker Studio.
